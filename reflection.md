- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Although most methods unique to the classes are not built upon the Building class methods, I see how they have "inherited" similarities that reduces lots of repetition in the constructor.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked: the code compiled and all the methods did what they should.
What didn't: currently nothing.
